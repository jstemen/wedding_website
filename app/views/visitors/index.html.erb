            <%= image_tag "lips.png" %>
            <p>Palak was born in New Jersey and raised in the suburbs outside of Atlanta, GA. After high school, she
                moved to Los
                Angeles, CA to attend the University of Southern California. Upon graduation, Palak began her legal
                career working at a
                large law firm. After two years of work, she decided it was time to get her law degree. Palak graduated
                with a J.D. from
                The George Washington University Law School in Washington, D.C. and began working in-house at large
                companies in the area.
                Her most recent position brought her to Seattle, WA.</p>

            <p>About the Groom</p>
            <%= image_tag "mustache.png" %>
            <p>Jared was born and raised in Columbus, Ohio. After high school, he remained in Columbus to attend Ohio
                State University.
                During his final year of undergrad, Jared was offered a position as a defense contractor in Washington,
                D.C., so he
                embarked on his journey to the nation&#39;s capital shortly after graduation. After two years of work,
                Jared decided to
                pursue a masters degree in his newest passion, software engineering. During this schooling, Jared began
                working at a
                start-up in the area. His new experience and education made him particularly desirable to many
                companies, and shortly
                after, he was offered an amazing opportunity in Seattle, WA. Jared continued his education and received
                a masters degree
                from the Johns Hopkins University in May 2014.</p>

            <p>Jaredï¿½s favorite pastimes include programming, bicycling, and working out.</p>

            <p>Our Story</p>

            Palak and Jared met in Washington, D.C. where they began their relationship. After two and half years of
            dating, the couple
            decided to move to Seattle, WA to further their careers. With nearly three years of dating under their
            belts, Jared decided it
            was time to pop the question. A year prior to the proposal, Jared had secretly requested Palak&#39;s
            parents&#39;
            blessing for
            her hand. In the months leading up to the proposal, Jared worked with Palak&#39;s friends to develop a
            proposal she was sure to
            say yes to. While visiting Los Angeles over labor day weekend, Jared proposed to Palak on the beach in
            Santa
            Monica, just after
            sunset, with the lights of the Santa Monica pier and ferris wheel providing a picturesque backdrop. He
            had
            hired a plane with
            an LED bottom to fly around the beach and water scrolling the following, &quot;Palak Shah, will you
            marry
            me? &lt;3 &lt;3
            &lt;3.&quot; As they began walking onto the sand, Jared pointed up into the sky and asked her to look
            up.
            Tears filled her eyes
            when she finally realized what was happening. With her friends cheering them on, Jared got down on one
            knee,
            presented Palak
            with a gorgeous ring, and asked her to marry him. She said yes, of course.
