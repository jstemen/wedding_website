                    <%= image_tag "lips.png" %>
                    <p>Palak was born in New Jersey and raised in the suburbs outside of Atlanta, GA. After high school,
                        she
                        moved to Los Angeles, CA to attend the University of Southern California. Upon graduation, Palak
                        began
                        her legal career working at a large law firm. After two years of work, she decided it was time
                        to
                        get
                        her law degree. Palak graduated with a J.D. from The George Washington University Law School in
                        Washington, D.C. and began working in-house at large companies in the area. Her most recent
                        position
                        brought her to Seattle, WA.
                        Palak's favorite pastimes include spending time with her amazing friends, reading, photography,
                        and
                        crafting.</p>

                    <p>Jared was born and raised in Columbus, Ohio. After high school, he remained in Columbus to attend
                        Ohio
                        State University. During his final year of undergrad, Jared was offered a position as a defense
                        contractor in Washington, D.C., so he embarked on his journey to the nation's capital shortly
                        after
                        graduation. After two years of work, Jared decided to pursue a masters degree in his newest
                        passion,
                        software engineering. During this schooling, Jared began working at a start-up in the area. His
                        new
                        experience and education made him particularly desirable to many companies, and shortly after,
                        he
                        was
                        offered an amazing opportunity in Seattle, WA. Jared continued his education and received a
                        masters
                        degree from the Johns Hopkins University in May 2014.
                        Jared’s favorite pastimes include programming, bicycling, and working out.</p>

                Palak and Jared met in Washington, D.C. where they began their relationship. After two and half years of
                dating, the couple decided to move to Seattle, WA to further their careers. With nearly three years of
                dating under their belts, Jared decided it was time to pop the question. A year prior to the proposal,
                Jared
                had secretly requested Palak's parents' blessing for her hand. In the months leading up to the proposal,
                Jared worked with Palak's friends to develop a proposal she was sure to say yes to. While visiting Los
                Angeles over labor day weekend, Jared proposed to Palak on the beach in Santa Monica, just after sunset,
                with the lights of the Santa Monica pier and ferris wheel providing a picturesque backdrop. He had hired
                a
                plane with an LED bottom to fly around the beach and water scrolling the following, "Palak Shah, will
                you
                marry me? <3 <3 <3." As they began walking onto the sand, Jared pointed up into the sky and asked her to
                look up. Tears filled her eyes when she finally realized what was happening. With her friends cheering
                them
                on, Jared got down on one knee, presented Palak with a gorgeous ring, and asked her to marry him. She
                said
                yes, of course.

                         until after graduating.  During college, Martha and Palak were inseparable - spending

                           lives in Fullerton, CA and is a lawyer.

                    over the long hours and never-ending workload. They would often call each other from
                    their respective offices and leave
                    the line open for hours with the speakerphone on, just to be able to vent when they
                    wanted. In 2013, Palak and Vanessa traveled to Turkey together. One of the highlights
                    of their trip was a breathtaking hot air balloon ride over the \"fairy chimneys\"
                    of Cappadocia at sunrise. Vanessa lives in Los Angeles, CA and enjoys outdoor

                <p></p>Traditionally, guests at Indian weddings give gifts of cash or gold. For those who would
                rather
                not
                participate in this tradition, Palak and Jared have registered for a small number of items at
                <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wedding/1ERDEUJY4VYFD">Amazon</a>. If you decide to give a
                non-cash gift, please do not bring it to the wedding as it would be difficult for us to transport it
                back
                the West Coast. Instead, please use the shipping address below:

                <p></p>
