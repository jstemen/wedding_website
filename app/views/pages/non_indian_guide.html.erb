<p class="P2"><span class="T1">A Non Indian's Guide to a Hindu Wedding</span></p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1">
    <span class="T4">We thought this guide would be helpful for those who have never attended a Hindu wedding ceremony. There's lots that happen during the ceremony which can get overwhelming or confusing, so hopefully this guide will help you understand what to expect!</span><span class="T5"> </span>
</p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1"><span class="T2">Dancing</span><span class="T3"> </span></p><p class="P1">
    <span class="T5">There's no doubt Indians love to dance; any excuse to dance, we will take it. When Jared and his family arrive at the temple, they'll spend a good amount of time just dancing outside the hall to Indian beats. It's a celebration, so don't feel shy and join in! </span>
</p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1"><span class="T2">Food</span><span class="T3"> </span></p><p class="P1">
    <span class="T5">At religious Hindu events, the food served is usually vegetarian. It will be no different at Palak and Jared's wedding. For those strict carnivores, don't you worry. We guarantee your tummies will be full by the end of the night! (Note: vegetarian does not mean vegan. Dairy products are a big part of a Hindu diet.) </span>
</p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1"><span class="T2">Games</span><span class="T3"> </span></p><p class="P1">
    <span class="T5">Since back in the day the bride and groom didn't know each other or their new in-laws, little games are typically played throughout the wedding ceremony to keep the joyous mood. It's really just being playful with the families to help break the ice. The games aren't necessarily announced or setup, they basically happen on the fly.</span>
</p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P3">
    <span class="T5">After the baraat, one of the most entertaining ceremonies is the 'Joota Chupai' which literally means 'hiding the shoes.' When the groom sits in the mandap it is customary for him and everyone else to remove their shoes. This is when Palak’s sisters, cousins, bridesmaid, and friends steal the groom's shoes and return them after a hard round of bargaining where they are promised money and gifts. It is the job of Jared’s brother, groomsmen, cousins, and friends to not let the Palak’s entourage steal the shoes, and at the same time the bride's side has to try their best to get the shoes and hide them.  The negotiation for the shoes is an entertaining event since the groom, while desperate not to be fleeced, cannot take his bride home without his shoes.</span>
</p><p class="P3"> </p><p class="P1">
    <span class="T5">During the last mangal phera (walk around the fire), Palak's brothers stop Jared by holding down his toe. Once negotiations settle (money), Jared will be allowed to continue walking.</span>
</p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1">
    <span class="T5">After each mangal phera, Palak and Jared are to sit on their chairs before continuing their next walk around the fire. Once they complete their last mangal phera, Palak and Jared sit down once more. However, this time the families tend to pay close attention to this since the person who sits down first tends to be the one who wears the pants in the family. If Palak and Jared remember this little tidbit of information, you'll see them racing to sit down first.</span>
</p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1">
    <span class="T5">At the end of the ceremony, Palak's mom will feed both Palak and Jared some sweets. When she goes to feed Jared, Jared will hold on to a piece of Palak's mom's sari and won't let go until he gets some money. </span>
</p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1"><span class="T2">Gifts</span><span class="T3"> </span></p><p class="P1">
    <span class="T5">Typically guests at Indian weddings give cash gifts or gold. They're given traditionally as a form of investment in the couple's future. During the wedding, there will be a table set-up:  At this table will sit a </span><span class="T5">gentleman or two with a book. They're basically keeping record of what everyone gives. It will be at these tables we'll have a card box available. </span>
</p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1">
    <span class="T5">Why do we do this? Back in the day, weddings were an expense some families couldn't afford, so the village would pitch in to help. On the wedding day, people would give two cash gifts: one for the parents and one for the person getting married. The cash for the parents is to help pay for the wedding. The cash given to the person getting married is to use for a rainy day to help their family if they so choose to. A record of this is kept on the wedding day to help save time after the wedding to create a list of gifts given. It also ensures that at the next wedding in the village, the monetary support is reciprocated. Please don't feel obligated to follow this tradition if you are not familiar with it. </span>

<p class="P1"><span class="T2">Gujarati Hindu Wedding Ceremony</span><span class="T5"> </span></p><p class="P1">
    <span class="T5">India, like the U.S., is made of several states (28 to be exact). Although two people may be Hindu, if they are from different states, their Hindu practices may be somewhat different. The foundation of Hinduism is the same throughout India and the world; however, the way we expand on that foundation varies from state to state, country to country. A Gujarati Hindu wedding ceremony is different from a Punjabi wedding ceremony which are different from a Tamil wedding ceremony (and so on and so forth..). To make things even more complicated, within the Gujarati culture, there are various traditions based on the family's trade (or in this day and age, the family's ancestral trade). The point is, if you've been to a Hindu wedding before, don't expect everything to be the same at Palak and Jared's wedding. </span>
</p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1"><span class="T2">Mandap</span><span class="T3"> </span></p><p class="P1">
    <span class="T5">The mandap is where the majority of the wedding ceremony will occur. If you will be entering the mandap, you will have to first remove your shoes. Traditionally Hindus take off their shoes before entering a temple or an area where there are idols of Hindu deities placed. The reason being, the soles of shoes absorb impurities from the ground. Since temples and other places of prayers are considered sacred, shoes (being impure) are not allowed to be brought inside. </span>
</p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1"><span class="T2">Seating</span><span class="T3"> </span></p><p class="P1">
    <span class="T5">Jared will be seated on the right hand side of the mandap; Palak will be seated on the left hand side. With that in mind, the bride and groom's family and friends will sit accordingly, however, one is not required to sit on any particular side.</span>
</p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1"><span class="T2">Silence</span><span class="T3"> </span></p><p class="P1">
    <span class="T5">Silence during an Indian wedding is important. Yes, everyone is there to celebrate the couple and the joining of their families, but it is also a social event to meet those you haven't seen in a while. Basically weddings are the reason we never have family reunions. So, there's no need to be offended if there isn't silence during the ceremony.. Palak and Jared won't be! At the same time, Palak’s parents request that for 45 minutes of the actual ceremony, everyone observes the silence so friends and family can participate, learn and enjoy the rituals. If one must talk, please excuse yourself and go to a place where you won’t be disturbing the ceremony.</span>
</p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1"><span class="T2">Size</span><span class="T3"> </span></p><p class="P1">
    <span class="T5">Let's face it, Indian weddings are HUGE! A standard size for a wedding is usually between 400-600 guests; however, Indian weddings have even been known to host over 1000+ people. (No.. Palak and Jared's wedding guest list won't be in the thousands.) Why are Indian weddings always so big? It may seem like the parents of the bride and groom have invited the entire city; however, the wedding is actually </span><span class="T5">the last celebration any parent will throw for their child. For parents, the wedding marks the beginning of their child's true independence as they start a new family. You can understand why parents' want to share this joyous occasion with others! </span>
</p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1"><span class="T2">Timing</span><span class="T3"> </span></p><p class="P1">
    <span class="T5">The wedding ceremony can get long.. like 2-3 hours long. For our wedding, we're planning our ceremony to be approximately an hour in length (once Palak enters the mandap). </span>
</p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1"><span class="T2">What (Not) To Wear</span><span class="T3"> </span></p>
<p class="P1">
    <span class="T5">Indian weddings are really colourful.. so colourful you'll feel like you're swimming through a box of smarties. When dressing up for events, stay on the formal side. Going too casual may make you feel out of place. Should you feel like dressing in Indian wear, there are lots of options for you: </span>
</p>
<p class="P1"><span class="T6">Kurta</span><span class="T5"> - A pant suit for men. The tops are long and usually come up to your knees. The pants are typically tapered. </span>
</p>
<p class="P1"><span class="T6">Salwar Kameez</span><span class="T5"> - A pant suit for women. Same concept as the kurta except more blingy. </span>
</p>
<p class="P1"><span class="T6">Lengha</span><span class="T5"> - A skirt suit for women. The tops can be short or long and the skirts typically come in A-Line or fish-tail. It has an extra piece of cloth which you would pleat and pin over your shoulder. </span>
</p><p class="P1"><span class="T6">Sari</span><span class="T5"> - A "dress" for women. This one can be complicated. It's almost a one size fits all, except for the blouse. And if you're taller than Palak, the underskirt/petticoat may need to be lengthened. Saris are something you wouldn't be able to put on yourself. The 5 to 6 metre long cloth can be worn in different ways, so if you want to wear a sari, you will have to make arrangements to find someone to help you. </span>

<p class="P1"><span class="T1">Explanation of the Hindu Wedding Ceremony</span></p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1">
    <span class="T4">Typically at Hindu weddings in North America, an explanation of the ceremony is given to each guest. In order to save some trees, we're providing that explanation here. Should you want to follow along during the ceremony, you can print out the </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/fileview?id=0B90stqtswBuQYWRlYmYxMjgtNTk0OS00MDE5LTkyYjUtMDM2ZTAwZjIwYTA3&amp;hl=en" class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T7">PDF version</span></a><span class="T4"> to bring with you.</span>
</p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1">
    <span class="T4">The Hindu ceremony is rich in tradition and culture, and is an elaborate, religious occasion, founded on 5,000 years of history. The ceremony unites a large number of family and friends who share in a day of celebration. On the stage there is a decorated canopy with four pillars, representative of the four parents, called the Mandap. The flowers adorning the Mandap symbolize beauty and joy. The grains of rice represent the food necessary to sustain life. The Hindu Sacrament of marriage, or Lagna – Sanskrit word, is believed to be the union of two souls; Rig Veda. Through each other, the Bride and the Groom fulfill their Dharma (moral duty) and become physically, emotionally and spiritually complete. A Hindu marriage represents an Eternal bond between husband and wife and also their respective families. </span>
</p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1"><span class="T2">Var Agaman: “Welcoming of the Groom”</span></p>
<p class="P1"><span class="T5">The Wedding Party is welcomed at the entrance of the venue by Brides Family. </span></p>
<p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1"><span class="T2">Pokhan: “Arrival ceremony”</span></p><p class="P1">
    <span class="T5">At the entrance, a ritual takes place to symbolize the official welcome of the Groom. After this welcome ceremony, a sapatia (small clay pot) is placed before the Groom’s feet which he must crush as a sign of physical strength. The Groom is then escorted to the mandap by the Bride’s mother where the wedding ceremony will take place. </span>
</p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1"><span class="T2">Ganesh Puja: “Worship of Lord Ganesh”</span></p><p class="P1">
    <span class="T5">The Priest and the Bride’s parents sit under the Mandap to perform the ceremony. The priest invokes Lord Ganesh and recites prayers to bring good luck and mark the beginning of the ceremony. Traditionally, all Hindu ceremonies begin with Ganesh Puja.</span>
</p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1"><span class="T2">Antarpat &amp; Kanya Agaman: “Arrival of the Bride”</span></p>
<p class="P1">
    <span class="T5">An Antarpat (white cloth) is held in front of the Groom by the family members to signify that Bride and Groom are separate individuals, and eight auspicious verses (Mangalshtak) are recited. The Bride then makes her entrance and is led to the mandap by her maternal family (mamas). </span>
</p><p class="P1"> </p>
<p class="P1"><span class="T2">Hasta Melap &amp; Kanyadaan: “Entrusting of the daughter”</span></p><p class="P1">
    <span class="T5">After the Bride has been seated in the mandap. A cotton cord with seven strands is placed around the couple’s shoulders. The cord signifies that united they can go through life without failing and the seven strands signify strength that comes with unity and harmony that prevails through mutual co-operation. The Bride’s parents give their daughter to the groom by putting the Bride’s right hand into the Groom’s right hand (Hasta Melap – joining of hands) while reciting sacred verses for the stability and longevity of their married life. A knot is tied between the Groom’s scarf and the Bride’s sari by the Groom’s sister. The knot and the joined hands of the couple represent the love that binds two souls for a lifetime. The Bride’s parents bless the marriage by praying to God and the antarpat is then removed. </span>
</p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1"><span class="T2">Varmala: “The couple exchanges garlands”</span></p><p class="P1">
    <span class="T5">The Kanyadaan is confirmed by the exchange of garlands between the Bride and the Groom, which symbolize the unification of their hearts, minds and souls. </span>
</p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1"><span class="T2">Mangal Phera: “Walk around holy fire”</span></p><p class="P1">
    <span class="T5">The Agni (Holy Fire) is now lit to invite God to witness the marriage. It symbolizes the presence of the Creator and is deemed to be the ultimate witness to the marriage. The couple walks around the Agni clockwise four times representing the sacred direction in life. Each revolution represents the four basic goals of humanity:</span>

</ul><p class="P1">

</p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1"><span class="T2">Saptapadi: “7 steps”</span></p><p class="P1">

</p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1"><span class="T2">Sindoor: “Vermillion Powder”</span></p><p class="P1">
    <span class="T5">The Groom will apply Sindoor on the parting of the Bride’s hair to signify she is now married to him. </span>
</p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1"><span class="T2">Kansar: “Offering of sweets”</span></p><p class="P1">
    <span class="T5">Sweets are handed to the married couple by both their mothers. The Bride and the Groom will feed each other to symbolize that during their lifetime together, they will share equally moments of happiness and sorrow. </span>
</p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1"><span class="T2">Ashirwad: “Blessings”</span></p><p class="P1">
    <span class="T5">Before leaving the mandap, the priest blesses the couple on behalf of the Gods and then their families come forward to give Ashirvad (blessings) for the future. The couple now leave the mandap as ‘one’ and begin their new life together. </span>
</p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1"><span class="T2">Varava Vanu: “Bridal send off”</span></p><p class="P1">
    <span class="T5">The Bride now bids a touching and emotional farewell to her parents, family and friends as she begins her new life and becomes member of the Groom’s family. </span>
